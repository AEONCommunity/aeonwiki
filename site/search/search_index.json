Also similar to Bitcoin, new blocks are added to the transaction history through a process known as mining . On average, about every 240 seconds a new block is added to this list containing new transactions and reward for the person who worked to add the new block. AEON blocks have dynamic size limit which increases as the demand increases. This is different from a fixed block size limit imposed in the Bitcoin protocol. It is not unlimited though and if you try to add a block which is too large, you will be penalized and have some of your reward subtracted. Block Size Every AEON block contains a list of new transactions to be added to the transaction history. When there are many transactions, the size of the block may be larger than the median block limit which is taken over the previous 100 blocks. A person who adds a block that is too large will be penalized according to how much they exceed that limit. No block can be larger than double the median block limit, otherwise it is refused by the rules of the protocol. There is a minimum median block size limit set to be 20000 bytes = 19.53125 kB . What does this mean for you as a user? Well, because there is no fixed limit, users to do not need to compete each other with higher fees in order to be included in the block. Additionally, the network security remains incentivized through the means of a constant tail-emission. This ensures that miners have a secured reward source and do not depend on fees. get_block_reward CRYPTONOTE_REWARD_BLOCKS_WINDOW CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_GRANTED_FULL_REWARD_ZONE_V1","title":"Blocks"},{"location":"blocks/#blocks","text":"Similar to Bitcoin, the entire AEON transaction history is stored on a long ordered list of \"blocks\".

When you create a new wallet, you start with one account. Every account has a primary address which starts with a W such as WmsjdgHjwpqRYnjj8BM8wpZqaz2KigHjC1y5uuur6BFC64V3ZRU5Xkg4PVgP7maVan7GQkRaFtHvqeNrhsLA93YG1i4Lp25XR This is like your email address. When someone sends you AEON, you need to share with them your address. Accounts Each AEON wallet can have many accounts. Within each account there can also be many minor addresses which can be shared to others. These addresses begin with an X . It is not advised to re-use the same address many times as it may become possible to associate your identity with a given address. So it is suggested to use a new minor address with every new contact. Every standard AEON address is 97 characters long. Public-Private Keypairs If you are familiar with encryption, public-key cryptography means there are two keys: a public key to be shared with everyone, and a private key to be kept secret. These keys are used together to encrypt and sign messages securely and privately through the laws of mathematics. Typically, the public key is used to verify signatures of the owner and to create encrypted messages for the owner. The private key is used to create signatures and to decrypt messages from the public. Spending Keypair Spending Public Key Used together with viewing public key to generate new one-time addresses to be used on blockchain for every transaction. Also used by the network to verify the signature of the outputs and accept transactions as valid. Spending Private Key The spending private key is used to sign outputs when the owner wants to spend funds. With the spending private key can you have complete control of the wallet, so it is important to keep this to yourself. Viewing Keypair Viewing Public Key Used with spending public key to generate new one-time addresses to be used on blockchain for every transaction. Viewing Private Key Used to scan the blockchain and find the funds sent to their address. At the protocol level, the sender performs an encryption with the recipient's public view key, and the recipient attempts to decrypt all the outputs on the blockchain to find the one belonging to him (where decryption was successful). For audit purposes, it could be shared with an auditor, along with the signed outputs to prove the balance of a wallet. Sharing only the viewing private key would enable the auditor only to see received transactions, but they wouldn't be able to tell which funds were spent.
