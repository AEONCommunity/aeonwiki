## Privacy as a basic expectation

The most popular digital currencies are failing to protect their users' privacy because they exposing their users' transactions and balances to the general public. If a currency is not private it is failing to fulfill its purpose as a currency. That is why AEON refuses to surrender any of the rights of its users. AEON is built on the Cryptonote protocol and therefore inherits the same privacy mechanisms that are present in Monero and other such coins. 

Unlike Monero, AEON has never included and never intends to include superficial encryption schemes such as RingCT that only go to create bloat in the transaction history. AEON intends only to implement the minimum necesarry cryptography so that the elementary rights of its users are not surrendered. This protects AEON from becoming a victim to flaws in experimental cryptography that could potentially cause a total collapse of the cryptoeconomic system such as hidden inflation or double spends. It also minimizes unnecessary and permanent data in the transaction history that is stored forever.
